The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), has brought about a revolutionary shift in agricultural monitoring. This project introduces a robust method for classifying water stress in cotton using a compact UAV platform and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Embracing smart irrigation management techniques empowers growers to irrigate with greater efficiency, promoting sustainable agricultural production. Crop evapotranspiration is a key quantity in enabling informed irrigation decisions.

This research was conducted at the USDA-ARS Cropping Systems Research Laboratory (CSRL) in Lubbock, Texas, where the cotton field was divided into 12 drip zones. The study included three replications to evaluate four irrigation treatments: “rainfed”, “full irrigation”’, “percent deficit of full irrigation”, and “time delay of full irrigation”. The CNN model was able to classify the cotton water stress using UAV-based RGB images with a 91% overall best prediction accuracy.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
